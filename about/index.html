                            <h3 style="margin-bottom: -20px;">By H.T. Correspondent, <h3>
							<h4><a href="javascript:;">The Hindustan times, Patna, July18, 2000</a>.
                            </h4>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-12">
                        <p>"Master of all trades retains hunger for learning" is Dr. Mallik in the eyes of a press correspondent of the Hindustan times, Patna, July18, 2000. The correspondent finds Dr. Mallik a doctor, engineer, scientist and businessman, all rolled into one. An MD, PhD, from USSR Kameshwar Nath Mallik holds command over four different and equally difficult streams.</p>
                    </div>
					<div class="col-md-12">
                        <p>One wonders whether it is possible for one single human to master four diversed streams, all at the same time and be a pioneering spirit in each. Having a super speciality degree in surgery, Dr. Mallik is expert in repairing the Mitral valves, organ transplantation, experimental surgery and oncology. He claims to have introduced more than 200 medical terminologies, has over 250 publications in medical science and many awards to his credit which include Bihar Shree-1992, unique personality of India Award-1984, Komsomolsky awards and the young scientist Lenin Award-1972.</p>
                    </div>
					<div class="col-md-12">
                        <p>With 33 years in research, teaching and medical practice, Mallik has business experience of over 18 years in industry, being the first man to be awarded a patent for lymphatic Venus communication by USSR, which got him into PGI Chandigarh to work on experimental liver transplantation and liver preservation.</p>
                    </div>
					<div class="col-md-12">
                        <p>Dr. Mallik has emerged as a 'last ray of hope' for many cancer patients. A notice in his clinic reads: "We undertake only those cases which are rejected by others". And he has reasons to be content with the fact that he has given life to over 1000 hopeless cancer patients. He also claims to have cured 12 aids cases till date.</p>
                    </div>
					<div class="col-md-12">
                        <p>A media shy, Mallik does all his experiments at his shabby looking clinic. Publicity for him is "an invitation to chaos," which he has "very bitter experience of handling".</p>
                    </div>
					<div class="col-md-12">
                        <p>Autopathy, a New mode of treatment that he has developed and mastered can detect and cure over 80 kinds of diseases, he claims. It involves taking patients' blood out, doing needful treatment to it and then introducing it back sublingually into ones system with no toxic or hazardous side effects. But the most surprising achievement is the artificially generated chain of petroleum products-petrol, diesel, kerosene etc- in his laboratory and has wisely patented the methods. He plans to put up unit for it's commercial production either in Kahalgoan or Meerut, if things go his way, he adds. A liquid discovered by him can increase the mileage of vehicle by 35 percent if mixed with petrol (0.1%only,v/v). He produces this on mass level and runs a whole network of establishment to distribute it in entire country in the name of Feacksol (petrol saver and substitute), Cuscutol (diesel saver and substitute) and exhaust pollution reducer. M/s Mallik Co-Petroleum India Pvt. Ltd. would soon be all India affair, he exclaims.</p>
                    </div>
					<div class="col-md-12">
                        <p>He has also developed a unique circuit which he claims, if put to use in each household, can generate the same amount of power it takes from the Government. You not only consume electricity but also repay back the same amount to the Govt., he claims. These have been put to public use on experimental basis in some houses. He was more than happy to show the place, where he turns his dreams in reality, his laboratory. One could mistake it with an electrician's workshop. The haphazard working room seemed to have nothing in place but the product it bears is unparalleled. His efforts have been noted in international journals/magazines/news papers. "Physics is my fiance and medicine is my wife", giggling Dr. Mallik adds.</p>

His mother was surprised for having painless birth of this child. Father was astonished having problemless postwar events and for improved Socio-Economic status. Teachers were incapable for assessing the ability of the child and permitted the child to complete his school education (Matriculation) at very early age. The child had equally good interest in agriculture & farming, sports and team leadership, social services and devotion to the God. He was found practising yoga from his very early age and he used to keep busy with studies or doing some experimentation like works for many hours together. He was known for his smartness, presence of mind, extra-ordinary knowledge of his subjects of studies, and was also appreciated for singing, playing musical instruments, painting, writing essays and poems, and for his memory. Elderly people used to like listening him for his witty and logical talks. </p>

                        <p>In August, 1952 he had a long dream in sleep regarding the forthcoming events of his Life. In February 1954 and August, 1962 again the same dream was recasted in detail. On the Basis of Experiences gathered during these years he could reassure himself about the future of his life and thus he became worry free knowing-what is lotted cannot be blotted. He was always surprised to see that all the times his dreams were true. Very seldom he used to have some dreams for reminding and reaffirmation of his future action of life. He could therefore, believe that Lord Shiva's Blessing is with him and as per dream he could happily enjoy the Sweet and Sour of his life. He knew well the future course of his life would be the same as shown in his dreams. He always knew before time about his educational and research out comes, marriage and children Births, changing Socio-Economic and family status, and about his role and participation in any unseen forthcoming events. He was several times recasted some portions of the dreams to explain the relation with some persons and events, and their correlations with several previous or forth coming Births. When ever he plunged in to meditation a silent forecasting used to reveal the forth coming results of the apprehended matters. </p>

Her father was given full informations and address of the future groom of his daughter. In a very dramatic manner the marriage was ceremonised and the co-existence was maintained. </p>
